# Google-Clone
A front-end clone of Google Search including Image and Advanced Search made from scratch using HTML &amp; CSS.

## Design and Functionality

This mini-project was made to match the aesthetics of Google Search, Image Search and Advanced search as closely as possible. To make things a little more interesting, the pages were designed to have a Monochrome look/theme.

The core-functionalities are achieved by redirecting to Google's original Search, Using the name attribute within HTML to convert queries into GET parameters included in the Google Search URL.
